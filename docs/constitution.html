<p>REVOCABLE WAIVER TRADE OPERATIONS OVERVIEW </p>

<p>b. Midnight on Monday/Tuesday: Team Y, the league’s second to last place team, puts in a claim for Player X </p>
<p>c. Thursday at 3 am: Team Y, as the worst team in the standings attempting to claim Player X, is awarded the claiming rights. The commissioner communicates to the league that Team Y has claimed Player X. At that moment, the negotiation window is opened until Saturday at 3 A.M PT. </p>
<p>d. 8 hours into negotiation window: Team X asks for Team Y&#39;s 3rd best farm player. Team Y declines. </p>
<p>e. 24 hours into negotiation window: Team X asks for Farm Player 1 and Farm Player 2 for Player X. Team Y counters with Farm player 3 and Farm Player 2 for Player X. Team X declines </p>
<p>f. 36 hours into negotiation window: Negotiations have hit a complete standstill. Team X decides that they are willing to swap Player X straight up for Farm Player 1, whom they deem as Team Y&#39;s best prospect. Exercising their right to do so, Team X emails the commissioner indicating that they are willing to proceed with Team Y&#39;s waiver claim, and that they will take Farm Player 1 as their single farm player compensation. The two players are swapped, 1-for-1 @ the 48 hour mark, with Player X now being granted to Team Y and Farm Player 1 going to the Team X. Both teams then make the necessary moves to their farm systems and rosters in order to ensure legal rosters </p>
<p>54) PLAYER TO BE NAMED LATER TRADING </p>
<p>Owners may complete transactions that include swapping future assets in exchange for players/picks.  </p>
<h2 id="ptbnl-operations-overview">PTBNL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>a) Team A is interested in a player from Team B roster.  </p>
<p>b)Team B isn&#39;t definitive on a desired return from Team A </p>
<p>c)Team A offers a PTBNL, which includes a list of agreed to a 2 to 5 assets which could be players, draft pick(s), minor leaguer(s), international funds, &amp;/or major leaguer(s) that will be used for future compensation.  </p>
<p>d)Team A and Team B announce trade of Player X for PTBNL, while noting the 2 to 5 pieces in which they agreed to as compensation pieces. </p>
<p>e) The outline of the agreed to transaction must be posted, in detail, within the comment thread of the transaction on the CBS Main Page. </p>
<p>f)On or before the 30 day mark from when the agreement was reached, Team B must then select one of the agreed to assets from Team A to complete the transaction. </p>
<p>g)During this 30 day holding period Team A may not trade and/or drop any of the agreed to compensation pieces </p>
<p>h)Teams may only have 1 PTBNL transaction pending at a given time </p>
<p>i) Current &amp; Future season draft picks MAY be used as compensation </p>
<p>j) When using future waiver additions/priority as compensation, rather than defined player(s)/pick(s) the process reads as follows: (see below) </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Both teams must post from the off-set of the transaction that waiver priority/future additions are going to be used as the future compensation in the PTBNL transaction. This is a must to allow for full league disclosure.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Both teams must also publicly acknowledge any stipulations within the transaction, such as agreed to volume of waiver additions that will be exchanged &amp; waiver priority ranges that are agreed to by both franchises (ie. Team A trades player x for a future waiver addition, barring that addition falls within spots 5 through 8 in the waiver order).  note* that if agreed to ranges are being used as a stipulation, then the teams must also document two contingency players that could be utilized as secondary compensation options should the trading team fail to meet/elevate to their agreed to placement in the waiver priority order within the given 30 day time allowance. By doing this the franchise acquiring the PTBNL can opt to select one of the two players if their trading counterpart fails to reach the agreed to waiver priority range come day 31 following the original transaction, rather than continue to wait for their waiver standing to elevate.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Within the initial 30 Days following the transaction, the teams may negotiate the use of the claim, but the team receiving the PTBNL may not mandate their trading counterpart to &quot;burn&quot; priority during this holding period, as it must still be mutually agreed upon. The team trading the PTBNL can also use waivers at their own free will during the initial 30 day pending process. If both franchises agree on/before the initial 30 days then the player must be added by Team A, and swapped to Team B (acquiring team) in exchange in a 1 for 0 deal. Within the comment thread of the completed trade, both teams must post an acknowledgement of compensation being finalized.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>If no compensation is agreed to within the initial 30 days (Team A refutes using their waiver priority or an agreement between franchises aren&#39;t met on a claim in the initial month), then from day 31 forward, the team acquiring the PTBNL can command their trading counterpart to use their waiver priority and/or choose one of the two contingency players to serve as compensation to finalize the transaction without recourse and/or negotiation. In this case, Team B (team acquiring the PTBNL) will send the waiver request into the commissioner, at which time the commissioner will add the player onto Team A roster, and then subsequently force through the trade onto Team B&#39;s roster.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>Teams acquiring waiver add/priority compensation are given until the A.S. game to redeem their compensary addition for an agreement made during the first half of the season, while any PTBNL trades involving waiver priority made post A.S. break can be redeemed up until the end of the CFBA regular season.  </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>k) If teams acquire a draft pick as the PTBNL deal then that pick follows the same statutes under amateur draft rules. </p>
<p>l) If a team acquires a Rule V player as a PTBNL,  that player must still up-hold the same Rule 5 limitations</p>
