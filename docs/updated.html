a) Place bid above tender to win said player 
or

<p>##CFBA LEADERSHIP COUNCIL (C.L.C) 
The CLC is a council comprised of veteran league members to aid in LM duties and is comprised of
Bedford Bulldogs, Milwuakee Brews, Windosr Lugnuts and YO MAMA. 
Rules subjective in nature or otherwise not clear will be decided solely by the CLC, who may request league suggestion and/or feedback.
LEAGUE PARTICIPATION--GM CODE OF CONDUCT 
Please just donâ€™t be an asshole and make this league fun to be in. Please be engaging in trade talks and not belittling or condescending to other league members. The CLC reserves the right to make adjustments or hand out punishments as deemed necessary. This should never be necessary, and if it becomes necessary owner removal will be in the discussion.
Owners are responsible to communicate to the CLC should anything need brought to their attention (trades not being responded to, remarks made in private channels, etc). </p>
<p>##CFBA Disciplinary Tiers<br>Verbal Warning - Message/email from the CLC letting you know you need to stop doing something youâ€™re doing, or start doing something you arenâ€™t.
Formal Warning - Once youâ€™ve been warned and behavior isnâ€™t changed in a reasonable amount of time
Termination - You continue to not fulfill your duties as a courteous, responsive owner and the CLC feels the league would be best fit moving on without you. This is subject to negotiation with the offending owner, but you will have had time to discuss before it gets to this point. 
If an owner is terminated mid-season or a team is abandoned, the commissioner will take team ownership of the vacant team until a replacement is made. The commissioner will not trade with the team as long as it is under their control. </p>
<p>##RULE CHANGES 
Suggestions for rule changes should be communicated to the CLC in season or in the offseason. In depth discussion may be held off for the offseason, but feel free to bring suggestions as you think of them. 
Rule changes require 12 votes to pass. </p>
